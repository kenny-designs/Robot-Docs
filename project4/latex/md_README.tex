\subsection*{Part 1\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item goal is to get from point a to point b, relying on the return of perfect review of position
\item Should use proportion control, figure out speed and turn rate
\item inverse relationship between speed and area
\item use square-\/root of area to force a linear relationship
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Part 2\+:}

{\itshape real-\/local\+: you do not have the benefit of perfect review of position}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item need to rely on laser to localize
\item your task is to finish particle filtering
\item particle filtering unleashes 100 or 1000 particles and allowing them to evolve. Particle filters return a bunch of possible positions.
\item must modify readposition function, because it currently gives bogus position
\item analyze read position function which has array of hypotheses. Element 0 in array is least likely position and last element has the highest probability. The function currently returns the lowest probability element in the array.
\item Localization is almost finished – when the number of hypotheses shrinks, the position get crystallized. You should wait until the number of elements in the array is 2. Then return the hypothesis with the highest probability
\item once the particle filter has finished its work, you cheat by comparing to the original position ( -\/6, -\/6)
\item to keep successful run direct output into a file – when you run real-\/local $>$ log.\+txt (this will allow you to override the previous log) , you can then submit the log file. Make sure you use cout to print message succeeding. Log.\+txt is proof that you have successfully completed project. Log.\+txt should have “success localization” and “success navigation”
